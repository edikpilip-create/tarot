# Project Guide

## Stack

- Next.js App Router
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Server route for Telegram submission at `src/app/api/telegram/route.ts`
- Static assets in `public/media`

## Key Commands

Use `npm.cmd` on this Windows setup if PowerShell does not resolve `npm` directly.

```powershell
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run dev
npm.cmd run build
npm.cmd start
npm.cmd run lint
```

- `npm.cmd run dev` starts the local development server with Webpack.
- `npm.cmd run build` creates a production build with Webpack.
- `npm.cmd start` runs the production server after a build.
- `npm.cmd run lint` runs ESLint across the project.

## Coding Conventions

- Prefer ASCII in code and configuration unless the file already uses Cyrillic text or another Unicode asset.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- Keep changes scoped to the requested section or feature.
- Preserve the existing App Router structure and local patterns.
- Keep page layout dense, dark, and editorial rather than marketing-style.
- Reuse existing CSS variables and component patterns before introducing new ones.
- Keep animations restrained and purposeful.
- Answer briefly and directly.
- When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in PLANS.md) from design to implementation.
- Use absolute imports through `@/*` when adding new project code.
- Do not remove user changes outside the requested scope.

## Self-Check And Testing

Before handing work back, run:

```powershell
npm.cmd run build
```

If the change affects styles or layout, also verify in the browser at `http://localhost:3000` with a hard refresh.

If the change touches the Telegram form or API route, confirm:

- the form still submits without client errors;
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are present in `.env`;
- the API route returns a successful response for valid data.

If the change affects SEO or metadata, confirm:

- `robots.txt` is reachable;
- `sitemap.xml` is reachable;
- the page title and Open Graph metadata still match the project.

## Notes

- The project currently uses `next dev --webpack` and `next build --webpack` because the Windows environment here is not using the native Turbopack bindings.
- Key visual assets currently live in `public/media` and are referenced directly from the page components and CSS.
